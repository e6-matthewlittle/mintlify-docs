## March

### Enhancements

**Transactions - Added ending balances in transaction model** <br/>
Extended the `TransactionDTO` to include `balancesAfterTransaction` which is an array of balances per currency wallet for the customer account after the transaction has been cleared.

**Term Deposits - Updated the ability to edit term deposit configurations in Dashboard** <br/>
Term deposit account configurations including `MaturityAction`, `ReinvestInterestPreference` and `ReinvestmentAmountPreference` can now be updated in the Financials tab of a term deposit customer in Dashboard.

**Term Deposits - Updated sweep processing to split different transactions out** <br/>
When a term deposit customer account reaches maturity and a sweep occurs, differences balances will be swept to the target account in different transactions. Interest that is swept will have a transaction type of `INTEREST`, while principal that is swept will have a transaction type of `P2P`, and any cancellation fees that are swept will have a transaction type of `P2P`. 

**Card Expiration - Added new card renewal summary report** <br/>
New Card Renewals report was added which provides a summary of all cards that were reissued due to upcoming expiration. Report includes details of the cardholder, the previous card, and the replacement card. The report will be generated each time the upcoming card expiration process runs and is generated as a JSON file.

**Reports - Added reversal flag to Card Clearing Messages Report** <br/>
Entries in the Card Clearing Messages Report will now include a `reversal` boolean to identify if the record was a reversal. This removes the need for clients to interpret multiple fields to determine if the network message was for a reversal.

**Card Expiration - Created upcoming card expiration notification** <br/>
Added new process to generate a file containing details of cards that are expiring within a set upcoming window.

**Fees - Added new consumption tax processing** <br/>
A new `tax` type transaction entry will be created when a transaction triggers a fee which is subject to a configured consumption tax. This will be separate transaction entry from the original transaction and the fee.

**Controls - Added new combined_purchase_30d rule** <br/>
New control was added that limits the amount of in person and online purchases made in a 30d (or monthly depending on configuration) period accounting for both authorizations and cleared transactions.

**Controls - Added new cash_in_limit control** <br/>
Added new control that limits the amount of inbound money from funding type activities for an account. This includes `load` transactions as well as inbound `p2p` transactions from non-child accounts.

**Card Tokenization - Enhanced tokenization authorization strategy fidelity** <br/>
Card tokenization authorization can now be configured at a higher level of fidelity for in-app push provisioning and manual provisioning.

**Dashboard - Updated person details page layout** <br/>
Person details page in Dashboard was updated to the new standard page layout to allow for greater flexibility in feature expansion. Person detail now has a person summary section and sub-pages including person details, accounts, cards, person attributes, contact methods, official IDs, geographical addresses, security answers, and history.

**Card Networks - Added support for MyDebit in Malaysia** <br/>
Card payments received through the MyDebit card network in Malaysia can now be processed once configured.

**Card Payments - Enhanced Mastercard 0120 message processing for FRM declines** <br/>
When a 0120 message is received from Mastercard where a decline has occurred due to FRM decisioning, additional ISO8583 attributes will be populated from the network message including `ON_BEHALF_SERVICE` and `ADVICE_REASON_CODE`. A declined transaction notification will also be generated and distributed as if E6 had declined the transaction.

**Controls - Update Mastercard fraud controls for 0120 messages** <br/>
Updated the `frm_fraud_score_threshold` and `frm_block_reason_codes` controls to also support processing on 0120 messages so that actions can be taken on a customer account in the case a decline is received from Mastercard FRM.

**Revolving Credit - Added estimated payoff disclosures for Canada** <br/>
Add minimum payment disclosures for evolving credit programs based in Canada in alignment with regulatory requirements for statements.

**Reports - Enhanced cutoff time configurations for card network message reports** <br/>
Updated the fidelity of cutoff time configuration for the Card Authorization Message Report and the Card Clearing Message Report so that report scope can be aligned with certain settlement windows as needed.

**3DS ACS - Extended VCAS support as 3DS ACS provider** <br/>
Implemented additional portions of VCAS integration so that VCAS can be used as a 3DS ACS provider including the ability to configure the VCAS step up methods per client as needed.

**Revolving Credit - Updated rounding for interest posting** <br/>
When interest posting occurs as part of the billing process, the unbilled interest amount will be rounded up when greater than or equal to 5 in the last decimal place of the currency decimal point precision + 1 decimal place. Conversely, it will be rounded down when less that 5 in the last decimal place. This will allow minor portions of interest to be posted even when less than a full value of the decimal point precision of the currency.

**Card Payments - Added Visa VAA/VRM field processing** <br/>
Added support for Visa Advanced Authorization (VAA) fields including `62.21` and `62.22` in Visa card payment processing for authorizations. These fields will be available in the `rawMessage` portion of the `NetworkMessageDTO`. E6 will now also create declined transaction entries in the E6 platform if the authorization was declined by the VRM.

**Dashboard - Corrected full page error on card details page** <br/>
Updated processing of card token data in Dashboard so that missing value for card token expiration does not cause a full page error in the card details page.

**Transactions - Updated transactions by card API input parameters** <br/>
The Retrieve Card Transactions API was updated to use `transactionSourceCode` and `transactionTypeCode` instead of `transactionSource` and `transactionType` respectively.

**Card Payments - Added authorization reversal for some Visa X120 messages when network STIP is used** <br/>
When a Visa authorization message is received with an MTI of X120, checks will be performed to see if E6 should attempt to reverse an existing authorization. In some cases, an X120 message is sent to indicate that E6 took too long to respond when card network stand in processing (STIP) is being used. When received in these cases, E6 will release any associated authorization holds as needed.

**Card Payments - Updated processing of multiple clearing for incremental authorizations** <br/>
Updated authorization hold release logic for scenarios where an authorization has had multiple incremental authorizations added and then a later clearing attempts to clear only a particular incremental authorization. If a clearing is received where the amount matches a specific incremental authorization then E6 will attempt to release only that authorization hold, otherwise if no match is found the entire authorization will be released as previously performed.

**Controls - Added new control to reject ecommerce purchases where 3DS has not been applied** <br/>
New `reject_ecomm_no_3d` control is available for Mastercard card payments. When set to `true` then the control will reject ecommerce card purchases where 3DS authentication data is not received as part of the authorization request.

The counter will be reset after the correct CVV has been provided.

Audit page in Dashboard was enhanced to increase usability and correct minor data mapping issue.
