# Q1 2023 release notes

Release notes highlight new functionalities, enhancements, and updates to the Tritium® platform. Releases become available to client deployments around the globe at different times. Your Episode Six (E6) representative will inform you when a release has impacted your test or production environments.

## Week of March 27, 2023

This week’s releases include the following changes to the E6 platform:

### New features

- Launched the new automatic load feature that allows accounts to be funded on a recurring basis, including repayment of revolving credit accounts. For more information, see [Automatic load](/docs/payments/automatic-load).

- Corrected an issue where the Dashboard incorrectly displayed repayment period end dates for revolving credit customers.

## Week of February 27, 2023

This week’s releases include the following changes to the E6 platform:

### Significant change

- Normalized the use of country codes in file generation and reporting to use two-character country codes instead of two or three-character country codes. The [Address API](/tech-specs/persons/person-geographical-addresses) and other APIs that accept a `countryCode` attribute will still accept two or three-character country codes, but all country codes will be saved and returned as two-character strings.

### New features

- Added new raw data extracts for customers, persons, geographical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers for account holders. For more information, see [Raw data extracts](/docs/reports/raw-data-extracts).
- Launched card-level controls, which give the ability to set up and enforce controls on specific cards along with account-level controls and program-level controls. For more information, see [Card controls](/docs/controls/card-controls).

### Enhancements

- **UPDATE March 20, 2023:** Corrected an issue where reports were not being sent for programs whose names contained spaces.
- Added a new `creationDateTime` field to the ISO 8583 Message Settlement Daily Report. This field is a human-readable version of the `creationDay` field in the program’s local timezone. The format is `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS z`, in which `z` represents the local timezone. For more information, see [Card clearing messages report](/docs/reports/card-clearing-messages).
- Added field DE48 including `walledId`, `DPAN`, and `tokenRequestorId` to the ISO Authorization and the ISO Settlement reports. These fields had already been present in the detailed transaction report. For more information, see the [Card authorization messages report](/docs/reports/card-authorization-messages) and [Card clearing messages report](/docs/reports/card-clearing-messages).
- Enhanced cooperative authorization / real-time-funding (RTF) and transaction notification payloads to include `interchangeName`. The interchange name was added to the CustomerTransactionNotification, CustomerTransactionFailureNotification, and AuthorizationErrorNotification. For more information, see [Cooperative authorization](/docs/cards/cooperative-authorization) and [Standard notifications](/docs/notifications/standard-notifications).
- Added two new fields to revolving credit statement files to improve the ability to generate statement files with localized times. The `creationTime` field is the creation date of the transaction entry in UTC time. The `creationDateTime` field is the creation date and time of the transaction entry in the program’s local time zone. The format is` yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS z`, in which `z` represents the local time zone. For more information, see the Statement File Specifications supplementary document.
- Corrected an issue related to FX transactions on revolving credit statement files. FX transactions will now have `fxRate` populated with no markup. Cross border payments will display markup amount and `fxRate` equal to 0.00. For more information, see the Statement File Specifications supplementary document.
- Added a new `markupType` attribute to revolving credit statement files. `markupType` indicates which type of markup is being applied to a foreign exchange transaction. This attribute can display two values: `DCC` and `CROSS_BORDER`. For more information, see the Statement File Specifications supplementary document.
- Enhanced the ability for cooperative authorization clients to send back fine-grained error codes. These codes include a new majorCode (610) for client-initiated errors. For example, TRITIUM will map a response code such as “610x61” from an RTF response to an RC=61 response to Visa or Mastercard. For more information, see [Cooperative authorization](/docs/cards/cooperative-authorization).
- Enhanced card automatic re-issuance processing so that only the latest card will be reissued if the card is `valid` and meets the required expiry condition.
- Enhanced card automatic re-issuance processing so that if one `externalReference` is associated with multiple customers, then only the latest customer’s card that is nearing expiration (one month before expiry) will be reissued.
- Enhanced card automatic re-issuance processing so that only cards that have recent transactions will be reissued.
- Corrected an issue where repeated cooperative authorization / RTF messages were being sent as part of authorization processing. This change was made for both production payments as well as the ISO 8583 simulator.
- Corrected an issue related to processing VTS notifications where Apple Pay is the token requestor.
- Simplified the error handling user experience in the Dashboard.
- Corrected an issue related to card expiry format displaying incorrectly when using non-English languages in the Dashboard.
- Corrected an error that kept card tokens from displaying in the Dashboard.
- Corrected an issue in the Dashboard where searching by customer number also returned results for cards.
- Corrected an issue in the Dashboard where searching transactions by date failed to return the expected results.
- Corrected an issue in the Dashboard where authorization holds were not displaying correctly.
- Corrected an issue in the Dashboard that prevented new users from being created.
- Corrected an issue in the Dashboard that kept customer control details from displaying for **CustomerAgent** and **RiskAgent** roles.
- Corrected an issue with card order dates displaying incorrectly in the Dashboard.
- Corrected an issue where the current balance was showing in ATM balance inquiries instead of the available balance.
- Corrected an issue with minimum payment due calculation where some minimum payments due were negative amounts.
- Corrected an issue where interest rates were not updating for interest rate tiers.
- Customer fees are now enabled for revolving credit customers. The Customer Fee API allows fees to be added only to specified revolving credit accounts, rather than via a fee plan at the program level. For more information, see the [Customer Fees API](/tech-specs/fees/customer-fees).
- Corrected an issue with revolving credit customers not being able to be switched from interest rate tier to direct interest rate configurations.
- Enhanced exception case mappings for MDES tokenization to improve cardholder error messaging, including incorrect expiry.
- Corrected an issue with cooperative authorization requests that have `forcepost = true` and experience a time out. Authorization webhook notifications will now be resent until an “Approve only” response is received.
- Corrected an issue with cooperative authorization requests that have `forcepost = false` and experience a time out. Reversals will now be retried and the original reversal request removed.
