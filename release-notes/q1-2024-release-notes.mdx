Release notes highlight new functionalities, enhancements, and updates to the Tritium® platform. Releases become available to client deployments around the globe at different times. Your Episode Six (E6) representative will inform you when a release has impacted your test or production environments.

## March 2024

### New Features 

**Revolving Credit - Added the ability to simulate billing day of month changes** <br/>
Users can now simulate a billing day of month change event as part of revolving credit account simulation in test environments.

**User Authentication - Added password requirement clarification** <br/>
All password screens in Dashboard now contain a disclaimer explaining password requirements management.  

**Revolving Credit - Added ability to not accrue interest on disputed transactions** <br/>
Revolving credit programs can now be setup so that disputed transactions are not included in certain revolving credit processes such as interest accrual and min due calculation. Transaction disputes can be registered using the Chargeback APIs.

**Rewards - Implemented reward plan cap and reward rule MCCs** <br/>
Reward plans can now have a reward accumulation cap set so that customers assigned to the plan can only earn a specified amount of rewards in a certain period.

**Cooperative Authorization - Added new partial authorization fields** <br/>
In support of partial authorization processing for E6 clients using cooperative authorization, we have added a new partialAuth field to authorization request payloads to indicate if a merchant accepts partial authorization. A new partialAmount field was also added to the response object so that an issuer can specify a partially authorized amount to be returned to the merchant.

**Notifications - Added cardNumber to customer risk notification** <br/>
`cardNumber` attribute was added to customer risk notification payload to better enable downstream identification of the card which triggered the notification

**Dashboard - Added the ability to set customer level loan preferences** <br/>
Customer level loan preferences can now be established for parent level installment customers through the Dashboard

**Rewards - Added customer level offset configuration** <br/>
Reward customer automated distribution and redemption timing offset can now be configured at the customer level. This allows specific customers to have their reward distributed on any day of the month as desired. Standard approach is typically to have reward distribution and redemption occur on the last day of the billing cycle for revolving credit customers.

**Fees - Added new fee rule data validation** <br/>
When setting up a fee rule, either one of the fee flat amount or percentage must be greater than 0 so that the fee rule is correctly being used during processing.

**Revolving Credit - Added new reward summary to statements** <br/>
Added a new postedRewards field showing the amount of rewards applied to the revolving credit account during a billing period.

**Revolving Credit -Added reward redemption repayment hierarchy processing** <br/>
When a revolving credit customer receives an automated or manual reward redemption from a rewards accounts, a positive amount will be processed according to the revolving credit repayment hierarchy. If the amount is negative due to refunds or other reasons, then the amount will be applied to the current period principal sub-balance.

**Card Schemes - Added support for EFTPOS processing** <br/>
E6 is now enabled to receive, process, and respond to card payment messages received through the EFTPOS network in Australia.

**Dashboard - Added the ability to cascade loan automatic load rule removal** <br/>
Users can now cascade a removal of automatic load rules from child loans when a removal action is taken at the parent installment customer in Dashboard.

**Dashboard - Added revolving credit payoff calculator support** <br/>
Added the ability for a customer service agent to simulate revolving credit account payoff within the current billing period from the Dashboard. This can be done from the Financials tab of a revolving credit customer.

**Revolving Credit - Added new non-processing toggle feature** <br/>
Added the ability to set a revolving credit customer to not have normal revolving credit processes including interest accrual, billing, repayment period close, automatic payment, and grace end be applied to that customer. This can be applied manually at the customer level or through a delinquency action. When the customer has the non-processing toggle turned off, the customer will have a new billing period and repayment end scheduled and interest will start to accrue again the next day.

**Revolving Credit - Added the ability to automate delinquency action return** <br/>
Delinquency action return behavior can now be set for revolving credit programs. Users are able to select a return period count and value that will apply for interest tier changes, minimum due profile changes, and risk level changes. Once the required count of good payment behavior periods has occurred, customers who have previously had the delinquency action applied will be set to the return value as configured.

**Dashboard - Added rewards summary to customer details page** <br/>
Users can now view a summary of pending and distributed rewards in a new Rewards tab when viewing the details of a particular customer if rewards have been configured.

**Dashboard - Added support for rewards program setup** <br/>
Reward type programs can now be setup via Dashboard. Rewards programs act as “rewards engines” to which other product programs can be associated for rewards earn, distribution, and redemption. Within the reward program configuration, users can setup rewards plans and the underlying rules for the product programs as needed. This can also be done through the new Rewards tab within the program details page.

**Revolving Credit - Added next billing close for delinquency action timing** <br/>
 Implemented the ability to have revolving credit delinquency actions be applied on the next billing period close. This allows interest rates to be updated starting next period rather than mid period to avoid having multiple rates being implemented in the same period which might lead to issues with statement requirements for interest rate disclosures. The default value for existing delinquency actions is graceEnd per the previous behavior.

 **Dashboard - Implemented new partner details page** <br/> 
 Implemented new partner details page within the Dashboard to expand the ability for clients to understand and manage the partners setup within their tenancy. This includes the ability to view and manage partner balances, attributes, IINs, change orders, and more depending on user roles and permissions. This replace the previous Dashboard partner details side drawer.

Removed sensitive information from error log export including authorization token in order to ensure secure data would not be unnecessarily exposed.

**Automatic Load - Corrected automatic load clearing issue** <br/>

**Notifications - Added creationTime to all customer notifications** <br/>

The loan customer account `customerNumber` should be passed into the Retrieve Offering Summary API path `GET /v1/offering-customers/{customer-number`}.
