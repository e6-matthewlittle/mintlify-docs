# Chargeoffs

A chargeoff is a type of transaction that specifies that the funds owed by a customer account are considered delinquent. Initiating a chargeoff is usually actioned after all other resolution paths with the end customer have been exhausted.

    Chargeoffs and adjustments are similar, but adjustments credit or debit the operating program, while chargeoffs debit or credit a specific partner user.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to write off a customer account balance. A chargeoff creates a transaction which takes funds from the customer balance and send the funds to the program operating balance.

## Prerequisites

In order to create a chargeoff, a customer account must first exist. For more information, see [Customers](/docs/customers/customers).

A change order must also exist to which the chargeoff request will be tied. For more information, see [Customer change orders](/docs/change-orders/customer-change-orders).

## Actions

To initiate a customer chargeoff request, call the [Create Customer Change Order Chargeoff Request API](/tech-specs/change-orders/customer-change-orders/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerChangeOrderAPI_createUpdateChargeoffRequest_PUT). The `customer-number` specifies the customer account whose funds are to be used in the chargeoff. The `change-order-id` specifies an encrypted identifier for a change order obtained from TRITIUM® API.

## What's next

Once an chargeoff has been processed, the customer’s balance is updated in real-time. For more information, see [Customer balances](/docs/balances/customer-balances).
