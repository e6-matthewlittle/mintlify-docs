# Balances overview

A balance is the amount of funds held by an account at any given time. Account balances include total balance (the full amount held) and available balance (the amount the account can use).

## Uses

Balances are used to authorize future payments against the account. The account must have enough funds in the balance to make a requested payment. Use cases for viewing balances include:

- Allowing a customer to view their balance in your customer mobile or web experience
- Decisioning a payment or other action based on the amount of funds in an account
- Allowing a customer service agent to see a customer's balance for customer inquiry support
- Making adjustments to an account balance
- Writing off an amount from a customer account balance

## How it works

Episode Six (E6) TRITIUM acts as a ledger and system of record for accounts managed by E6. This includes maintaining customer account balances and transaction histories which lead to the current balance.
