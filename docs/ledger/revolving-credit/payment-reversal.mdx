# Payment reversal

When a revolving credit customer has made a payment on their credit card balance, that payment can also be reversed. Examples of scenarios that require payment reversals include failed automatic load transactions or payments made with insufficient funds.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) enables payment reversals for revolving credit customers. Payment reversals can be performed calling the Product Actions API. For more information, see [Product actions](/docs/products/product-actions).

## Prerequisites

Before performing a payment reversal, a customer with revolving credit configurations is required. For more information, see [Revolving credit customer configuration](/docs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customer-configuration). The customer must have made at least one payment to reverse in the current Billing Period.

<Callout

    Payment reversals should not be initiated for payments made in previous billing periods or if subsequent payments have been made in the same billing period. In the event of a historic payment reversal being required a sub-balance adjustment should be performed.
</Callout>

## Actions

To perform a payment reversal, call the [Reverse Payment API](/tech-specs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customers/api?#operation/reverseRevolvingCreditCustomerPayment). In the request, set `name` to `reversePayment`.

To identify the payment being reversed, provide a caller reference in the API request. In the `attributes` object, set the `name` to `callerReference` and provide the caller reference string in the `value` attribute. The caller reference is a stable identifier for a transaction generated by the system. If you need to retrieve the caller reference, call the [Generate transaction list API](/tech-specs/transactions/transactions/api#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.TransactionAPI_listTransactions_POST).

When a payment is reversed, the amount paid is reapplied to each of the account sub-balances according to the program's repayment hierarchy. Any delinquencies that were paid off by the payment, such as unpaid minimum dues, are added back onto the account balance. For example, if a customer minimum payment due of $100 is paid off by a $1000 payment, but that payment is later reversed, the $100 minimum payment due will be added back to the account.

### Optional: Charge a reversal fee

There is an option to charge a fee while making a reversal request. To charge a fee, include an additional `attribute` object in the reversal request. Set the `name` attribute to `chargeFee` and the `value` to `true` or `false`. If `true`, a fee is charged when a payment reversal occurs. By default, `chargeFee` is set to false.

### Optional: Add an external reference

An external reference can be created for the reversal transaction. This reference can be used to retrieve the reversal later. To create an external reference for the payment reversal, include an additional `attribute` object in the request. Set the `name` to `externalReference` and provide the external reference string in the `value` attribute. The external reference can be between 1-64 characters long and cannot include any special characters other than dashes or underscores.

## What's next

After a payment is reversed, you can view the updated account balances by calling the [Retrieve Revolving Credit Customer Summary API](/tech-specs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customers/api?#operation/retrieveRevolvingCreditCustomerConfiguration).
