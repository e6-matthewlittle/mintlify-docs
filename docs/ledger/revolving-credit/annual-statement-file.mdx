# Annual statement file

In addition to statements received each billing period, revolving credit customers can also receive an annual statement. This statement summarizes account activity over the last 12 billing periods, such as the total amount spent across each balance type, total repayments, and total fees charged. For clients using revolving credit functionality, Episode Six (E6) can generate an annual statement file containing information to be printed on each customer’s annual billing statement.

## File behavior 

An annual statement file is generated when at least one of a program's customers have received 12 billing statements since account opening or their last annual statement. The file is output at 4 AM in the program's local timezone on the date of the customer's twelfth billing statement. One annual statement file is produced per program. Once generated, the file is made available through the S3 service.

When a customer's annual statement is generated, an [AnnualStatementCloseNotification](/docs/notifications/credit-notifications/#annualstatementclosenotification) is triggered containing details from the customer's annual statement.

Each annual statement file uses JSON format and is generated into a .txt file. The annual statement file uses the following file name formatting:

| Sample                            | Format                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CreditCardTest-20230102020000.txt | [programName] + “-” + [timestamp(yyyyMMddHHmmss)] + “.txt” |

When a customer's annual statement becomes available, the annual statement details can also be retrieved via API by calling the [Annual Statement API](/tech-specs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customers/api?#operation/annualStatement). In the request, set `name` to `annualStatement`. To limit the number of annual statements returned in the response, include an `attributes` object with `name` set to `limit` and `value` set to the maximum number of statements to return. 

## Fields 

Throughout the annual statement file, the following value formatting is used unless otherwise noted:

- All numeric values are rounded to two decimal places
- All dates are provided in `yyyyMMdd` format

Each annual statement file is divided into the following sections for each customer account:

1.	Customer
2.	Address
3.	Summary
4.	Usage details
5.	Fee details

The following tables describe the fields included in each section. For an example of an annual statement file, see the appendix.
