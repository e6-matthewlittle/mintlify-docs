# Statement file

Every month, Episode Six (E6) generates a statement file in JSON format for clients using E6 revolving credit functionality. This file contains information to be printed on customer billing statements, such as customer account information, personal information, and transaction histories. This file is sent to your designated statement provider once generated.

## File behavior

A statement file is produced per program for every billing date. Each file includes every account under that program that was billed in that period. By default, Tritium® assigns a billing period by the date of account creation. However, a preferred billing date can also be specified during account creation.

The statement file is generated at the end of the billing period at 2 AM on the billing date. For example, if a billing date is set for the 15th of each month, the statement file will be generated at 2AM on the morning of the 15th.

When a customer's `billingDayOfMonth` is updated during a statement period, the statement for the current period is generated as scheduled on the original billing date. The end of the next billing period is then determined, ensuring a minimum span of 28 days for the billing cycle. For example, if the `billingDayOfMonth` is updated from `20` to `5`, the system will need to extends the billing period beyond the immediate next 5th day of the month to the second occurrence of the 5th day of month after the previous close to satisfy the 28-day requirement.

Each statement file uses JSON format and is generated into a .txt file. The statement file uses the following file name formatting:

| Sample                            | Format                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CreditCardTest-20230102020000.txt | [programName] + “-” + [timestamp(yyyyMMddHHmmss)] + “.txt” |

## Fields

Throughout the statement file, the following value formatting is used unless otherwise noted:

- All numeric values are rounded to two decimal places
- All dates are provided in `yyyyMMdd` format

Each statement file is divided into the following sections for each customer account:

1.	Customer
2.	Address
3.	Account
4.	Transactions
5.	Summary
6.  Default fee information

For an example of a statement file, see the appendix.

  The following sections document the standard fields of the statement file. As needed, the statement file can also include region-specific fields to comply with local regulatory requirements. These regional values are also displayed in the <tt>attributes</tt> section of the billing history object. For more information on the region-specific fields that can be displayed in the statement file, see the [Appendix](#Appendix).

If `markupType` is `CROSS_BORDER`, an `fxRate` value is shown. `FOREIGN_CURRENCY` is displayed if the transaction is made using a different currency than the acquirer currency. If the transaction occurs in the program's country using the program's compliance currency, this field displays an empty string. |

For a transaction without a hidden fee, this attribute will display the same value as `fxRate`. |
| Foreign Exchange Rate Including Markup (Inverse) | `fxRateWithMarkupInverse` | BigDecimal | Inverse of the `fxRateWithMarkup`.
