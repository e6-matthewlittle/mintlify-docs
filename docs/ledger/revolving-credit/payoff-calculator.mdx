# Payoff Calculator

A payoff calculator projects a revolving credit balance to a future date, calculating a figure necessary to clear the account's projected obligations on that date. This tool aids customers in planning financial events and is a regulatory requirement in certain jurisdictions.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides access to a payoff calculator for revolving credit customers. Payoff calculations can be performed by calling the Product Actions API, or from a revolving credit customer's Financials page in the Dashboard. For more information, see [Product actions](/docs/products/product-actions). 

The payoff calculator will compute a payoff amount on a future payment date that sums:

- Billed sub-balance principal amounts
- Billed sub-balance interest amounts
- Unbilled interest amounts
- An application of a late payment fee

To generate the payoff amount the calculation will make some assumptions. If a program operator's or customer's actions are different to the assumptions, then the payoff calculator cannot provide an accurate estimate.

- No transactions to occur between current date and payoff date
- No program or customer config changes between calculation date and payoff date
- No delinquency actions applied between calculation date and payoff date
- No interest forgiveness logic applied for customer (interest will charge)

## Prerequisites

Before performing a payoff calculation, a customer with revolving credit configurations is required. For more information, see [Revolving credit customer configuration](/docs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customer-configuration).

## Actions

To perform a payoff calculation, call the [Payoff Calculation API](/tech-specs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customers/api?#operation/calculatePayoffAmount). In the request, set `name` to `calculatePayOffAmount`.

To specify a date for the calculation, provide a pay off time in UNIX epoch time. In the `attributes` object, set the `name` to `payoffTime` and provide the pay off time string in the `value` attribute. The pay off time string must be a time that occurs within the customers current billing cycle.

## What's next

After a payoff is calculated, you can view the existing account balances by calling the [Retrieve Revolving Credit Customer Summary API](/tech-specs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customers/api?#operation/retrieveRevolvingCreditCustomerConfiguration).
