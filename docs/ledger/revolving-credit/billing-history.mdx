# Billing history

A revolving credit customer billing history summary is an overview of a credit customer's activity during a specified billing period. At each billing period close, a new billing history summary is provided for each customer account. Viewing a customerâ€™s billing history allows you to facilitate customer account management, review the history of a customer account over time, and understand the context around customer decisioning.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) maintains billing history summaries for each revolving credit customer account opened under a credit program. Billing histories can be retrieved calling the Product Actions API with the `billingHistory` action type specified in the request.

Each billing history summary tracks a customer's billing period start and end date, draw balances, minimum payment due, and payment due date. A customer's six most recent billing histories can be retrieved.

## Prerequisites

Before retrieving a customer's billing history summary, a customer with revolving credit configurations is required. For more information, see [Revolving credit customer configuration](/docs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customer-configuration).

## Actions

To retrieve a customer's billing history, call the [Retrieve Billing History API](/tech-specs/revolving-credit/revolving-credit-customers/api?#operation/retrieveRevolvingCreditCustomerBillingHistory). In the request, set `name` to `billingHistory`.  In the `value` attribute, provide the maximum number of billing histories to return in the request.

A successful request returns an array of billing history summaries. History summaries are returned in chronological order, with the newest summaries appearing first. Each history summary is timestamped with the `billingPeriodStart` and `billingPeriodClose` in UNIX Epoch Time.
