# Interest posting

Interest posting is the process of posting a financial transaction for the amount of interest that has accrued on a customer account. At that point, the interest earned becomes part of the principal and can be accessed by the customer like any other portion of their account balance.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to configure and automatically process interest posting for an interest-bearing deposit program. All customers within an interest-bearing deposit program will have interest posted at the same time. The timing of this process is based on the program `distributionFrequency` and `distributionOffset`. The posted interest amount will be rounded to the decimal point precision of the balance currency.

    E6 currently only supports monthly as a distribution frequency.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Interest posting will only be processed on interest-bearing deposit customers that have been [configured](/docs/interest-bearing-deposits/customer-configuration).

If there is a `closed` or `termination` block on a customer account, then interest posting will not be performed on that customer account. For more information, see [customer blocks](/docs/blocks/customer-blocks).

## Actions

Interest posting is done automatically on a daily basis and no action is needed by a user. Interest posting results in a transaction from the program operating account to the customer account with an `interest` transaction type code. Posting will include all interest accrued since the last interest posting.

## What's next

After interest has been posted, principal balances for a customer can be viewed in the `totalBalances` array returned from the [Retrieve Interest-Bearing Deposit Customer API](/tech-specs/interest-bearing-deposits/customers/api?#operation/retrieveInterestBearingDepositsCustomer). Customers can also view a detailed history of interest transactions. For more information, see [Transactions](/docs/transactions/transactions).

Reports can be used to manage the interest-bearing deposits program and its customers. The [Program net positions report](/docs/reports/program-net-positions) will summarize all posted interest activity daily and provide a line-item reporting interest payments so that you are able to manage the operation of the product. The [Customer transactions report](/docs/reports/customer-transactions) can then be used to gain further understanding into the net positions found in the Invoice Report.
