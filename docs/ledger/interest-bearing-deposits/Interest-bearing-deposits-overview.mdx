# Interest-bearing deposits overview

Interest-bearing deposit accounts allow customers to earn interest on their account balance. This provides an incentive for customers to leave funds in the account in return for interest yields. Companies which offer interest-bearing deposit accounts can then use the deposited funds to back other activities such as lending or investment.

## Uses

Common use cases for interest-bearing deposit accounts include:

- Interest-bearing checking accounts
- Savings accounts
- High yield savings accounts

## How it works

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to configure interest-bearing deposit products. Customer account interest rates can be set using interest rate tiers so that customer rates can be easily set and maintained. Each customer of the interest-bearing product will accrue interest on deposited funds based on the program and customer level configurations. On a period basis, accrued interest will be posted to the customer account from the program operating account.
