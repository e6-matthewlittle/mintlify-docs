# Savings goals

Savings goals allow an interest-bearing deposit customer to subdivide their interest-bearing account. Dividing the account up allows for different goals to be managed and tracked including accumulation of funds and interest accrual.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to add savings goals to an interest-bearing deposit account as child accounts. Once setup, the savings goals can have money movements performed to and from the parent interest-bearing deposit account. Savings goals earn interest using the same configurations as the parent account.

## Prerequisites

To create a savings goal account, an interest-bearing deposit customer account is required. To create a customer interest-bearing account, see [interest-bearing deposits customer configuration](/docs/interest-bearing-deposits/customer-configuration).

## Actions

To open a savings goal account, call the [Create Savings Goal API](tech-specs/interest-bearing-deposits/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.offering.ibd.InterestBearingDepositAPI_createSavingsGoal_POST). An `amount` must be specified in the request. This amount will automatically be debited from the parent interest-bearing deposit account and credited to the savings goal account. Customers can also give the savings goal an account nickname or target amount by using the `customerAttributes`.

## What's next

Customers can add additional funds to their savings goal account by calling the [Process Savings Goal Funding API](tech-specs/interest-bearing-deposits/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.offering.ibd.InterestBearingDepositAPI_savingsGoalLoad_POST). The parent interest-bearing deposit account will be debited for the amount of the load. Customers can withdraw funds from savings goal account by calling the [Process Savings Goal Withdrawal API](ech-specs/interest-bearing-deposits/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.offering.ibd.InterestBearingDepositAPI_savingsGoalWithdraw_POST). The parent interest-bearing deposit account will be credited for the amount of the withdrawal.
