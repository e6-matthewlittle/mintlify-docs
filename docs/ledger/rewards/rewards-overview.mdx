# Rewards overview

Rewards are incentives provided to customers to encourage different types of activities including spend. Often times, the incentive is in the form of cashback on an account, loyalty points, or rebates. These incentives can be used to drive product competitive advantage, drive new account openings through promotions, and increase spend volume on accounts.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to enable rewards for any product programs in the TRITIUM platform. Rewards features supported by E6 include:

- Enabling rewards for a product program
- Establishing product reward plans and their underlying rules
- Assigning and changing reward plans for customers
- Setting up merchant category or merchant-specific constraints for rewards earn
- Accruing rewards earn
- Distributing earned rewards
- Automatic or manual rewards redemption
- Adjust rewards balances

## How it works

Rewards are enabled by creating a rewards processing program and customers within the program to manage earned rewards until distribution of the rewards. The rewards program also maintains the reward plan and rule configurations for each product program in an "engine" type structure. Each product program can have multiple plans. Each plan can have multiple earn rules within it. Rules can be tailored as needed with transaction type, rate, and merchant category or merchant qualification rules.

You can add rewards to your product by establishing a program for rewards processing, onboarding your product programs with plans, and then enrolling customers.
