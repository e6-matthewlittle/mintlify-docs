# Fee waivers

A fee waiver exempts an assessed fee from applying. Fee waivers can be used to limit more costly customer actions by granting a set number of free uses before fees apply. For example, ATM transaction fees might be waived for the first five withdrawals in a month, but additional withdrawals would then incur a fee.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) allows you to set fee waivers at the fee plan and individual customer levels to prevent assessed fees from applying. Once active, a fee waiver will prevent matching transaction source and transaction type fees from being applied. For more information see [Transactions](/docs/transactions/transactions). 

## Prerequisites

For a fee waiver to be added to a fee plan, a fee plan must first exist. For more informaton see [Fee Plans](/docs/fees/fee-plans).

## Actions  

Fee waivers can be added to fee plans or directly to customers, with a set number of uses defined by the `freeCount` and a replenishment cycle known as the `type`. The `freeCount` specifies how many times the waiver will activate and prevent a fee from applying, while the `type` determines the frequency of this count resetting, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
