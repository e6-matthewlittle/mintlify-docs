# Fee rules

Fees allow a program manager to monetize the products that they offer to their customers. Fees can be triggered by different event types such as payments or recurring dates. These triggers allow fees to align to events that a program manager might want to disincentivize for their customers, such as late repayment.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) manages a catalog of fees that can be charged to partners or customers. E6 also manages the triggering of the fee calculation and the posting of the fee to the partner or customer account in the E6 ledger.

### Fee calculation methods

Fee rules can be set up using various calculation patterns, including fees that are a flat amount, a percentage, or a combination of both. With the `fixFee`, `percentage`, and `calculationMethod` fields, you can configure how fees are applied to transactions made using your fee plan. The following types of fee calculation methods are available:

| Fee Calculation Method | Description |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Flat Amount | A flat currency amount to charge as the fee, such as $15. |
| Percentage | The percentage of the transaction to charge as a fee, such as 3% of the transaction balance. |
| Flat + Percentage | A combination of a currency amount and percentage to charge as the fee. For example, if a $100 purchase has a flat amount fee of $10 and a percentage amount fee of 5%, the total fee is $15. |
| Greater Of | The fee amount is the larger of either the flat amount or percentage amount. For example, if a $50 purchase has a $5 fee flat amount and a 5% fee percentage, the $5 flat fee amount is charged. |
| Lesser Of | The fee amount is the lesser of either the flat amount or percentage amount. For example, if a $50 purchase has a $5 fee flat amount and a 5% fee percentage, the 5% fee percentage amount is charged. |

To realize these calculation methods, refer to the following pattern of API parameters.

| Dashboard value | API value |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Flat amount     | fixFee > 0, percentage = 0, calculationMethod = 0 |
| Percentage      | fixFee = 0, percentage > 0, calculationMethod = 0 |
| Flat + Percentage | fixFee > 0, percentage > 0, calculationMethod = 0 |
| Greater Of      | fixFee > 0, percentage > 0, calculationMethod = 1 |
| Lesser Of       | fixFee > 0, percentage > 0, calculationMethod = 2 |

## Actions

Once fee rules have been selected for configuration, the fee can be added to a program’s fee plan for all the customers created under that program. For more information, see [Fee plans](/docs/fees/fee-plans). The fee can also be added to a single customer as a customer fee. For more information, see [Customer fees](/docs/fees/customer-fees). Fees can also be set up as partner fees.

## What's next

Fee transactions can be viewed along with other transactions for a customer. For more information, see [Transactions Overview](/docs/transactions/transactions-overview).
