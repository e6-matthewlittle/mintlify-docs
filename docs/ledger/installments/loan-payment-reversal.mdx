# Loan payment reversal

When a loan payment is made against an installment loan balance, it can be reversed if necessary. A loan payment reversal involves removing a failed or mistaken payment from the loan ledger and unwinding its implications on the account and customer balances. This process ensures that all financial records are accurately reflected after the reversal.

## What we do

When a loan is created, Episode Six (E6) manages the ledging of the loan balance and program rules. Payments made to specific loans or loan parent customers are assigned to various loan installment payments due, according to the balance repayment hierarchy and payment schedule repayment order set at the installments program level.

A loan repayment can cross different loan balances, and in the case of a failed or mistaken payment, when reversed all balances need to be unwound to reflect accurate loan amounts. When the payment reversal is made, the payment will be removed from all relevant balances, and the customer's records will be updated accordingly. If a customer would have been considered delinquent due to the failed payment, their delinquency counter will be adjusted to reflect the reversal, including any fees that would have been levied.

## Prerequisites

To make a loan payment reversal, at least one child loan customer must have been created from a parent installment customer, see [Loan creation](/docs/installments/loan-creation). After the loan has been created, a loan repayment must be made before a payment reversal can occur. For more information, see [Loads](/docs/payments/account-funding). 

## Actions

To make a loan payment reversal, call the [Loan Payment Reversal API](/tech-specs/installments/installments-customers/api?#operation/loanPaymentReversal). Provide the customer number of the parent installments customer in the `customer-number` path parameter. In the request body, set the `name` attribute to `reversePayment`. In the `subjectId` object, set `subject` to `Customer` and `id` to the parent customer’s `customerNumber`. In the `attributes` object, set the `name` to `callerReference`. In the `value` attribute, provide the installments child customer load transaction's `callerReference` number intended to be reversed.
  
### Optional: Charge a reversal fee

There is an option to charge a fee while making a reversal request. To charge a fee, include an additional `attribute` object in the reversal request. Set the `name` attribute to `chargeFee` and the `value` to `true` or `false`. If `true`, a fee is charged when a payment reversal occurs. By default, `chargeFee` is set to false.

### Optional: Add an external reference

An external reference can be created for the reversal transaction. This reference can be used to retrieve the reversal later. To create an external reference for the payment reversal, include an additional `attribute` object in the request. Set the `name` to `externalReference` and provide the external reference string in the `value` attribute. The external reference can be between 1-64 characters long and cannot include any special characters other than dashes or underscores.

## What’s next

Call the Retrieve Loan Summary API throughout the lifecycle of the customer's loan to track the customer's progress in repaying the loan. To retrieve a loan summary, call the [Retrieve Loan Summary API](/tech-specs/installments/installments-customers/api?#operation/retrieveLoanSummary).
