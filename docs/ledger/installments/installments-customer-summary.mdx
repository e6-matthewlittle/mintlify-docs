# Installments customer summary

Managing installments customers requires real-time access to customer information, such as each customer's available credit, applicable loan preferences and outstanding loans. This data can help enable a positive digital experience for end customers and allow for effective customer servicing.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to access a real-time summary of an installments customer. The installments customer summary contains a snapshot of the customer's overall credit limit at the time of retrieval as well as an array of the customer's outstanding loans and the customers applicable loan preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before retrieving an installments customer summary, an installments configuration must be added to a customer account. For more information, see [Installments customer configuration](/docs/installments/installments-customer-configuration).

## Actions

To retrieve an installments customer summary, call the [Retrieve Installments Customer API](/tech-specs/installments/installments-customers/api?#operation/retrieveInstallmentsCustomer). A successful request returns the customer’s installments summary. An array of all of the customer's loans will be returned in the `loans` object. Each loan will be identified by the `customerNumber` of the loan child customer account. 

## What’s next

After retrieving an installments summary, customer administration can be performed using the customer summary information. To retrieve more information about any of a customer's loans, the loan child customer account's `customerNumber` can be used to retrieve the loan summary. For more information, see [Loan summary](/docs/installments/loan-summary).
