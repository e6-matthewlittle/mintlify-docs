# Exchange margins

An exchange margin is the rate obtained from an exchange provider when exchanging one currency for another. The margin applies to a specific currency. Exchange margins are the additional pricing charged on top of the base rate provided by the exchange.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to manage currency margins. You can also can apply different exchange margins based on fee plans. E6 enables you to add an exchange margin to the rate obtained from an exchange provider. Exchange margins can be assigned to all programs or specifically to an operating program and fee plan.

## Prerequisites

To manage margins, you must have exchanges set up. For more information, see Exchanges. Optionally, if the margin is intended to be assigned to a specific operating program, the margin must be assigned to the desired program. Currencies that are paired together must both be supported by the E6 tenant.

## Actions

You can retrieve, update, and delete exchange margins by calling the [Exchange Margins APIs](/tech-specs/FX/exchange-margins).

## What's next

After setting up exchange margins, you can perform FX transfers to exchange funds within a multicurrency deposit account. For more information, see [FX transfer](/docs/fx/fx-transfer). You can also use safe drafts to automatically withdraw funds in all supported currencies. For more information, see [Safe Drafts](/docs/fx/safe-drafts). You can view, update and delete exchange margins by using the [Exchange Margins APIs](/tech-specs/FX/exchange-margins).
