# Exchange providers

A currency exchange provider is an entity that offers liquidity for a currency by processing a currency trade or foreign exchange (FX). The exchange provider offers buyers and sellers of various currencies a market for exchange. The exchange provider charges a fee or margin for the exchange.  

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) integrates with exchange providers as necessary to enable FX in the E6 system. Exchange providers are linked to the E6 system for the purpose of using E6 APIs.
