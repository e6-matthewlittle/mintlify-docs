# External Transactions

An external transaction is a record of a money movement from one account to another which is not handled by a ledger. This allows the ledger to track payments which may eventually affect the balances within it. In particular, this is important when the ledger initiates a transaction but the transaction is handled by a separate payment processing system.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to track external transactions for accounts within TRITIUM. These are used for transactions such as [Cooperative authorization](/docs/cards/cooperative-authorization) and [Automatic load](/docs/payments/automatic-load). External transactions are created and then resolved once the payment processing system informs TRITIUM of a result or a set time has passed.

## Prerequisites

Before retrieving external transactions for a given account, the ``portfolioId`` must first be obtained. The ``portfolioId`` is the unique identifier of the account within the product ledger. This identifier can be from a customer or a partner.

## Actions

Transactions can be retrieved for a given customer or partner account using the [List External Transactions API](/tech-specs/transactions/pending-transactions/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.TransactionAPI_listPendingTransactions_POST).
