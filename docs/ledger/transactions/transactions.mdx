# Transactions

A transaction is a record of a money movement from one account to another. Each transaction is made of a credit and debit of equal amounts allowing for easy reconciliation of money movements.

The opposing side of the credit or debit to an account could be a customer account, the program account, or a partner account.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides transaction processing and histories within the product ledger. This includes the creation of transactions as part of card and non-card payments. Transaction types can vary depending on the source and reason for the transaction. For more information, see the [Appendix](#Appendix). E6 supports dual entry for financial transactions where each financial transaction has two entries: one for the destination and one for the source of funds.

## Prerequisites

Before retrieving transactions for a given account, the `portfolioId` must first be obtained. The `portfolioId` is the unique identifier of the account within the product ledger. This identifier is the encrypted `id` from a customer, program, or partner object.

## Actions

Depending on the use case, transactions can be retrieved in different patterns. The most basic form of transaction retrieval is to call the [Generate Transaction List API](/tech-specs/transactions/transactions/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.TransactionAPI_listTransactions_POST). This provides a paginated list of transactions for the target `portfolioId`. If the transaction use case requires card payment data from the ISO8583 messages, then an expanded DTO option exists which can be retrieved using the [Generate Transaction List with ISO8583 API](/tech-specs/transactions/transactions/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.TransactionAPI_listTransactionsWithISODTOs_POST). These APIs use standard E6 [pagination](/tech-specs/getting-started/pagination).

Authorization holds and transactions can be displayed is a single list using the [Retrieve Customer Auth Holds and Transactions API](/tech-specs/transactions/authorization-holds/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerAPI_listAuthorizationsAndTransactions_GET). For more information, see [Authorization holds](/docs/transactions/authorization-holds).
