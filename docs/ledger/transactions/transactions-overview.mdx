# Transactions overview

A transaction is a record of a money movement which affects an account balance. A transaction is made of a credit and debit of equal amounts allowing for easy reconciliation of money movements.

## Uses

Transactions are used to view the historical payments which lead to the current account balance. Use cases for viewing balances and transactions include:

- Allowing a customer to view their transaction history in your customer mobile or web experience
- Allowing a customer service agent to see a customer's transaction history for customer inquiry support
- Enabling data reporting and analytics through curation of custom transaction attributes

## How it works

Episode Six (E6) acts as a ledger and system of record for accounts managed by E6. This includes maintaining customer account balances and transaction histories which lead to the current balance.

As a part of payment processing, E6 creates the transaction records related to the payment and posts transactions in the E6 ledger. A single transaction can have one or more transaction entries. A transaction entry is an individual credit or debit related to various sub-transactions of the root transaction. E6 also records declined transactions in order to support exception case support as needed.
