# Transaction attributes

A transaction attribute is a piece of information that defines a transaction within a data model. Systems define transactions differently across their data models. Inherently, each data model definition in a system remains relatively static. Static definitions cause issues when trying to customize the definition of a transaction or migrate transactions between systems. To overcome the problem of static definitions, customizable transaction attributes are needed.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability for custom transaction attributes to be added to and maintained for a transaction. A transaction attribute is defined by the `name` and `value` of the attribute. Transaction attributes can be retrieved for a transaction or consumed as part of downstream processing.

## Prerequisites

Before a transaction attribute can be added for a transaction, the transaction must have been created. For more information, including a list of transaction types, see [Transactions](/docs/transactions/transactions).

## Actions

A transaction attribute can be added by calling the API for that transaction type and defining the `name` and `value` for the attribute. For example, you can create a purchase transaction by first calling the [Purchase API](/tech-specs/payments/purchase/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.commerce2.MerchantAPI_purchase_POST) and then defining the `name` and `value` attribute for the call. Attributes should be uniquely named to ensure that transaction attributes follow a key-value pair model.

With your external payment gateways, you can also create transaction attributes that E6 can retrieve.

## What's next

After setting transaction attributes, you can retrieve them by calling the [Transaction Attributes APIs](/tech-specs/transactions/transaction-attributes).
