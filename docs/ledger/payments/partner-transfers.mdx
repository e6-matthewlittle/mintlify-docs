# Partner transfers

Partner transfers allow money movement from one partner to another. Partner transfers allow one party to manage pools of funds in a ledger and then reallocate those funds to other parties as needed. Examples of use cases include:

- Enabling a third party to preload funds for future disbursement to customers
- Managing nostro account currency trade balances

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) allows you to transfer funds between partner accounts. When a transfer is made, the target partner’s account is credited, while the initiator partner’s account is debited. Partner transfers can include multiple money movements across different currencies in a single request.

## Prerequisites

To transfer funds between partners, you must have partners set up. Both partners must be set up with the currencies to be transferred. To learn more about setting up partners, see [Partners](/docs/platform-access/partners).
After the partners have been created, a partner linkage must be established before transfers can be made. To learn more about linking partners, see [Data segregation](/tech-specs/getting-started/data-segregation).

## Actions

To transfer funds from partner to partner, call the [Partner Transfer API](/tech-specs/payments/partner-transfer).

## What's next

After the partner transfer is completed, you can view the new balances of the credited and debited partner accounts. You can view the balances by calling the [Get partner account balances API](/tech-specs/balances/partner-balances/api#tag/Partner-Accounts).
