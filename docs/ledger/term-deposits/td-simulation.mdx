# Term deposit simulation

Term deposit simulation is a testing tool that provides the ability to show how interest will accrue across a customer's account balances given a series of transactions. Simulation can be used to ensure that interest accrues on customer transactions as expected and that a program's interest settings are configured correctly.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to simulate term deposit customer accounts via a simulation API. The API allows you to simulate time passage and transaction events over the lifecycle of a customer account. Simulated transactions will accrue interest based on the program-level interest configurations. A list of events can also be provided in the request. The response is an array of account summaries.

    The Term Deposit Simulation API is only available in sandbox and testing environments. The API is not available in production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you run a term deposit customer simulation, a program with term deposit configurations is required. To create an interest-bearing deposit program, see [program configuration](/docs/term-deposits/program-configuration).

## Actions

To perform an interest-bearing deposit customer simulation, call the [Simulate Term Deposit Customer API](/tech-specs/term-deposits/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.offering.simulate.td.TermDepositSimulatorAPI_simulate_POST). In the request, provide values for the `startTime` and `endTime` attributes in UNIX epoch time. These values define the time frame over which the simulation takes place. Configurations for the term deposit customer will need to be provided. Optionally, updates to the term deposit program configurations can be provided as well to facilitate different testing scenarios.

    Every timestamp in the API request must occur in the past. For example, if a simulation is run on September 2, 2022, at 9:00 AM GMT (UNIX epoch time: 1662109200), the start time and end time can be no later than September 1, 2022, 11:59 PM (UNIX epoch time: 1662076740).
</Callout>

To simulate customer events, provide an array of events in the `simulationEvents` array. Each event object requires an `eventTime` timestamp in UNIX epoch time. There are two types of supported events:

| Category | Description |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `summary` | A summary of the account at the time of the given timestamp. The summary reflects all transactions that occurred prior to the summary timestamp. |
| `cancellation` | A cancellation of the account at the time of the given timestamp. |

A successful request returns an array of customer account summaries for each summary event specified in the request. Each account summary reflects all simulated transactions that took place before the account summary timestamp.

## What's next

After performing a customer account simulation, the details of the customer can be retrieved like any other customer including balances and transactions.
