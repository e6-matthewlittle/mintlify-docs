# Program configuration

Program-level term product configurations are shared configurations that apply to all customer accounts created under the program. These configurations include interest accrual settings and a default interest rate.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to configure a term deposit product for an existing program in TRITIUM. When term deposit configurations are added to a program, the program is updated to support term deposit behavior. After setting up the term deposit product, the program product configurations can be viewed and updated in real time.

## Prerequisites

E6 must enable access to the term deposit product.

    Contact your E6 representative to ensure that access to this feature is available.

Before adding term configurations to a program, a program must first be created. For more information, see [Programs](/docs/programs/programs).

## Actions

Term deposit configurations can be added to a program by calling the [Create Term Deposit Program API](/tech-specs/term-deposits/programs/api?#operation/createTermDepositProgramConfiguration). Common interest accrual settings including `daysPerYear`, `leapYearDaysPerYear`, and the `defaultInterestRate`.

## What's next

When a program is set up with term configurations, customer offering accounts can be opened under the program. To create a term offering customer, see [Term deposit customer configuration](/docs/term-deposits/customer-configuration).

The program configurations can be retrieved and updated by using the [Term Deposit Program APIs](/tech-specs/term-deposits/programs).
