Roles and permissions are a control mechanism which works to selectively allow access to a system based on a user's assigned roles. A permission is the ability to invoke a system processes exposed as external-facing APIs. A role is a label assigned to a user typically defined around user actor types. Each API is given a list of allowed roles which are able to invoke the API. When a user makes an API request, the allowed API roles are compared to that of the requesting user. If the user does not have a required role, then the request is declined.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides a role and permissions framework for all users of the TRITIUM platform. Each user can be assigned on or more roles at the time of user creation or after the user has been created.

## Prerequisites

Roles can be assigned to a [user](/docs/users/users) at any point after that user has been created.

## Actions

A user's roles can be updated by calling the [Update User Roles API](/tech-specs/users/user-roles/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.partner.UserAPI_updateRoles_POST).

## What's next

Once a user's roles have been set as required, the user can begin making API calls which are permitted by the user's roles.

## Appendix

The following roles are provided by E6 to be assigned to users.

### Approver

The **Approver** role gives the user the ability to approve change requests as well as to view and search history of change orders. This permission includes change requests across the customer, partner, and program levels.
