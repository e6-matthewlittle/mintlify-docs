A password or passphrase is a string of characters that a system user provides to verify its identity. When authenticating with a system, a username and the password are provided. If the provided password matches the expected value, then the user is provided authorization to access the system. Passwords are expected to be kept secure so that actors other than the user cannot access the system.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides identity and access management for the TRITIUM platform using usernames and passwords. Passwords are set for new users created within TRITIUM. Once created, users can use those passwords to access the platform. Users can also change their passwords or reset their passwords if required.

While E6 manages the passwords, password requirements are set by your organization and not managed by Episode Six. Please see your organization's implementation guide for password requirements. Once the password requirements have been set they can be retrieved to assist in password setup and validation.

    All clients using E6 Cloud must use password with at least 12 characters and which contain both alphabetic and numeric characters, in accordance with PCI standards.

## Prerequisites

Partner password requirements should be established using the `0` partner security level. Available password requirement configurations include:
* `partner_password_special_chars`
* `partner_password_min_length`
* `partner_password_max_length`
* `partner_password_uppercase_count_min`
* `partner_password_lowercase_count_min`
* `partner_password_number_count_min`
* `partner_password_special_chars_count_min`
* `partner_password_min_number_of_groups`

Initial passwords are generated during new user creation using the [Create User API.](/tech-specs/users/users/api#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.partner.UserAPI_create_POST).

## Actions

E6 allows the following password actions to be made.

### Change password

A user may want to change their password if they believe that it has been compromised. A password can be changed using the [Change Password API.](/tech-specs/users/passwords/api#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.partner.UserAPI_changePassword_POST) Both the `oldPassword` and a `newPassword` must be provided in this request.

### Reset password

If a user cannot remember their password, then they can request a password reset. A password reset can be initiated using the [Generate Password Reset Token API.](/tech-specs/users/passwords/api#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.PartnerAuthAPI_forgotPassword_POST) Password reset prompts can be delivered via email or SMS message, depending on your organization's configuration. Once a password reset token has been generated, it can be used to reset the password using the [Reset Password API](/tech-specs/users/passwords/api#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.PartnerAuthAPI_resetPassword_POST).
