# Secret Management

Secrets are sensitive information items which should not be accessed or visible unless given the correct access and permissions. Examples of secrets can include passwords, keys, or tokens. Once these secrets are stored, they can be later retrieved through secure means in support of downstream processing activities as needed.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to store and manage secrets within the TRITIUM platform. Common use cases for storing secrets in the TRITIUM platform can include provided E6 with a bearer token for calling your system APIs or storing a public key for encryption of secured files. E6 allows secrets to be saved and manged at the bank, partner, program, or customer levels.

    E6 will help you to understand if you need to provide a secret for any of the TRITIUM system functions. We do not recommend using this capability unless explicity guided to do so.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

A secret can be created once the root bank, partner, program, or customer entity has been established.

## Actions

Clients must securely provide a shared secret with Episode Six (E6) for each of their environments such as system integration testing (SIT), user acceptance testing (UAT), or production. The secret value must be a base64 string (512 bits). To create a secret, use the [Create Secret API](/tech-specs/system/secrets/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.keymanagement.PortfolioSecretAPI_add_POST).

## What's next

Once a secret has been created it can be managed using the [Secrets APIs](/tech-specs/system/secrets). This includes the ability to migrate an existing secret using the [Migrate Secret API](/tech-specs/system/secrets/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.keymanagement.PortfolioSecretAPI_createFromApplicationKey_POST). When migrating a secret, the `portfolioType` and `portfolioName` must match the original secret as the target secret.
