The Episode Six (E6) platform provides a foundation on which you can build any number of financial and payment products. Our platform offers two core products, Cards and Ledger, through a single integration. Depending on your use case and how much you want E6 to do, you can choose what products and features you use. Each product feature is orthogonal, meaning you don't have to accept every part of a product if you don't need it.

## Supported use cases

E6 actively powers a wide variety of use cases. Whether it's your first product, or you want to add on additional use cases with E6, we have you covered. Below is a list of use cases that E6 can support. If it's not listed below, we can still probably help. Reach out to your E6 representative to discuss what we can do for you.

## E6 operating system (E6 OS)

Cards and Ledger are both built using the E6 OS. The E6 operating system is the core of our platform around which everything else is managed. There are two key frameworks of the E6 OS for you to understand, customer management and platform access. Customer management is everything you need to offer a financial or payment product to your customers. Regardless of the use of Cards or Ledger features, the same key entities are always used including programs, customers, and persons. To offer a product to your customers, you first set up the program and configure its features and behaviors. Then you create customers for the program and tie the customer records to appropriate persons, with persons being a natural persons or legal entities. The second key framework, platform access, is our standard framework for managing you as a client, the parties involved in your operations, and your financial counterparties. To learn more about our E6 OS, see [Customer management](/docs/customer-management) and [Platform access](/docs/platform-access).
