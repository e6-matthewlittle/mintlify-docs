# Account closure

When an account is closed, the account no longer holds a balance and cannot be used to make payments. Common scenarios that require account closure include:

- The customer no longer requires the account
- The account customer has been blocked from using the account
- The customer is deceased

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to close an account and to reopen that closed account. This ability allows a customer account to be shut off from further payment processing.

## Prerequisites

A customer account must exist for it to be closed. For more information, see [Customers](/docs/customers/customers).

Before closing an account, the balance of the account must be taken to zero. Taking the balance to zero can be done through any combination of the [Withdraw](/tech-specs/payments/withdraw), [Adjustment](/tech-specs/payments/adjustment), or enabling chargeoffs with [Customer Change Orders](/tech-specs/change-orders/customer-change-orders) APIs.

## Actions

An account can be closed directly, which causes multiple closing actions to occur on the account and creates a closure block. To close an account directly, call the [Close Customer Account API](/tech-specs/customers/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerAPI_closeAccount_POST). Calling this API creates a `closed` block on the account if the block does not already exist. This call also sets any issued cards on the account to an  `invalid` [state](/docs/cards/card-state-management) and sets any associated [Official IDs](/docs/persons/official-ids) to `inactive`.

If the request is made with `delayed` set to `true`, then the card and official ID state updates are performed at a later time.

The delay on state updates is set to one day by default. If another delay time frame is needed, contact your E6 representative.

## What's next

After an account has been closed, it can be reopened with the [Reopen Customer Account API](/tech-specs/customers/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerAPI_reopenAccount_POST) so that the customer can resume making payments on the account.
