# Customer graphs

Customer graphs are a means of connecting customers that relate to each other outside of the standard hierarchical parent-child structure. Occasionally, customer accounts need to relate to one another in an undefined, cross-hierarchy manner. Customer graphs are particularly important when specific operations need to take place between accounts, such as funds sweeping or scheduled money movements.

## What we do
Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to create inward and outward connections between customer accounts. An inward connection is an account having an operation performed on it by a different account. An outward connection is an account performing an operation on another account. Specified operations can be tied to these relationships between accounts.

## Prerequisites
To establish customer graphs, more than one customer account needs to exist. To set up customers, see [Customers](/docs/customers/customers).

## Actions
To connect customers using graphs, you can create inward and outward connections. To create an inward connection, call the [Create Inward Customer Graph API](/tech-specs/customers/customer-graphs/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerGraphAPI_createInwardCustomerGraph_POST). To create an outward connection, call the [Create Outward Customer Graph API](/tech-specs/customers/customer-graphs/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerGraphAPI_createOutwardCustomerGraph_POST).

Contact your E6 representative to enable operations to take place as part of a graph relationship.

## Whatâ€™s next
Once you have made inward and outward connections, you can manage those connections calling the [Customer Graph APIs](/tech-specs/customers/customer-graphs).
