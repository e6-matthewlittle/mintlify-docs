# Customers overview

A customer relationships cross-section of your payment or financial product and a person as a customer counterparty. Offering a product to your customers requires the initial setup of your product, onboarding of customers, account opening, and then lifecycle management for both the product and the customer accounts.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) gives you the ability to set up a financial or payment product in our platform as a program and then create customers accounts for that product as needed to give counterparties governed access to your product. The customer account is the core entity for you to manage the customer relationships for that product-person combination. The program and customer entities become the central hubs for all other E6 platform feature utilization across Cards and Ledger.
