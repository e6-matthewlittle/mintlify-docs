# Card controls

Card controls allow clients to limit how a specified card is used. These controls help to prevent overuse, fraud, and other forms of risk. Common uses for card controls include:

- Limiting certain account holders' activity through cards
- Creating one-time use cards with limited usability on a single account

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to set up and manage customer-level and card-level control rules. Card controls can be associated with an issued card and are linked to customer-level control rules.  For example, if a customer account has a purchase limit of $500 and the account’s card has a purchase limit of $200, then card activity would be controlled by both customer-level and card-level control rules. Once created, card controls can also be managed and removed as needed.

## Prerequisites

To create control rules on a customer card, a card must be [issued](/docs/cards/issuance-overview).

## Actions

To create a card control for an individual card, call the [Create Card Level Risk Exception API](/tech-specs/controls/card-controls/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CardAPI_createCardRiskException_POST). When creating a card control, the card must be specified in the request along with the control `paramName` and `paramValue`. Ensure the provided `paramValue` is valid (numerals only, no alpha-numericals, no special characters apart from decimal points) and matches the data type of the related `paramName`. The `paramValue` field has a character limit of 1,024 for card controls.

 For more information on the allowable control rule types for card controls, see the Appendix.

Optionally, a release time for the card control can be included so that the control will automatically be removed from the card once the release time has occurred.

    Card controls can be added independently or can further restrict matching active program and customer controls

## What’s next

As card payments are processed, the card controls will be activated according to how the controls  are set. See [Card payment decisioning](/docs/cards/card-payment-decisioning) for more information. Card controls can be managed and removed by calling the [Card Controls APIs](/tech-specs/controls/card-controls).

## Appendix: Card-level control parameters

This table lists card-only control parameters that can be applied to customer cards.
