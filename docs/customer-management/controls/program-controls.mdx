# Program controls

Program controls are customer restrictions set at the program level that are applied to groups of customers. Setting restrictions on customer groups allows for different controls to apply to multiple customers at the same time. These controls can be used to create temporary onboarding restrictions for customers who have not completed their verifications. These controls can also be used to allow customers to move between program control levels based on account statuses, including delinquency.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to create and define program control levels. Within program control levels, different control rules can be added and configured. Once the control level has had all required rules configured, customers can be assigned to that control level. Customers can be moved between control levels as needed so that the control level definitions are static while the customer assignment changes.

## Prerequisites

To add program controls to a program, a program must be created. For more information, see [Programs](/docs/programs/programs-overview).

## Actions

### Adding a control level

To create a program control level, call the [Create Program Control Level API](/tech-specs/controls/program-control-levels/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.operating.RiskAPI_createRiskLevel_POST). The control level must be assigned a numerical `securityLevel` identifier during creation. The identifier must be unique as it will be used to add rules to the control level and to assign customers to the control level.

<Callout
    calloutType={'info'}
>
    `securityLevel` must be an integer between 0 and 99.
</Callout>

### Adding controls to the control level

To add a control to a created control level, call the [Add Program Level Control API](/tech-specs/controls/program-control-levels/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.operating.RiskAPI_createUpdateRiskConfig_POST). The `securityLevel` field of the target program control level must be provided. The control must also include a `paramName` from the list of controls found in the [Appendix](#appendix-available-controls). When adding a control ensure that the `paramValue` provided is valid (numerals only, no alphanumericals, no special characters apart from decimal points) and matches the data type of the related `paramName`. For example, `load_limit_1d` calls for TYPE `BigDecimal` such as `100`; if `one hundred` is provided instead, the control will be added to the control level but will not function correctly, potentially disrupting or breaking other control measurements. The `paramValue` field has a character limit of 65,535 for program controls.

For controls with a `paramName` ending in `_30d` such as `atm_30d`, program-level plugins can configure these parameters to measure over a rolling 30-day period or reset at the start of each calendar month. Contact your Episode Six representative to enable calendar month configurations. Once enabled, this setting applies to all parameters ending in `_30d`; you cannot mix calendar month and rolling 30-day control measures within the same program.

    The addition of a control rule to a program control level creates a change order, which requires approval.
</Callout>

## What’s next

After establishing a program control level, the level and all associated controls can be managed calling the [Program controls APIs](/tech-specs/controls/program-control-levels). To finish adding a control to a control level, a change order request must be approved. For more information, see [Change orders](/docs/change-orders/program-change-orders).

Customers are assigned to the default program control level upon creation. A customer’s assigned program control level can be updated after creation calling the [Update Customer API](/tech-specs/customers/customers/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerAPI_updateCustomer_PUT).

Customer performance against program controls can be viewed using control measurements. For more information, see [Control measurements](/docs/controls/control-measurements).

| `withheld_mcc`                               | String     | E6 Plugin Required. A comma-separated list of Merchant Category Codes (MCCs). This rule detects withheld MCCs in a clearing message where no prior authorization occurred and posts the transaction amount to the program operating balance instead of the customer balance. Clients can review these transactions in the Transaction Report and make necessary adjustments to the customer account. This scenario may occur due to force-post clearings from unexpected MCCs for a particular program. |
