# Control measurements

Control measurements are an assessment of how a customer account is performing against the controls enforced for that customer. For more information about control levels, see [Program controls](/docs/controls/program-controls). Measurements provide the ability to see where a customer is performing against each control limit.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability to get real-time control measurements for a customer. Measurements are provided in realtime to provide an optimal customer and customer servicing experience. Each measurement provides the control name, the current customer measure, and the defined limit being enforced.

## Prerequisites

Before viewing the control measurements for a customer, the customer must first be created. For more information, see [Customers](/docs/customers/customers).

Controls must also be configured that apply to the customer either through [Customer controls](/docs/controls/customer-controls) or [Program controls](/docs/controls/program-controls).

## Actions

To see the real-time control measurements for a customer, call the [Retrieve Customer Control Measurements API](/tech-specs/controls/measures-and-alerts/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CustomerAPI_getTransactionAlerts_GET). This call returns a list of all customer control measures for both program control levels and customer controls.
