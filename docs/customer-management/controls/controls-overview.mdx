# Controls

Controls are used to restrict customer activities including both payment and non-payment activities. Controls can be used to meet a number of use cases for a financial or payment product including:

- Ensuring all customers for a product adhere to regulatory requirements
- Including risk mitigation as part of risk management strategies for fraud and other risk sources
- Allowing consumers to self-impose controls on themselves or family members
- Enabling corporate controls for use cases like expense management

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides a comprehensive control framework to limit customer payment and non-payment activity. Controls can be configured at the program level, the customer segment level, the customer level, and the card level. When an action, such as a payment, is performed on a customer account that is governed by a configured control rule, the rule will be enforced as part of the approval of that activity. E6 provides the following types of control rules:

| Rule type | Description | Example |
| ------------ | -- | -- |
| Matching | If an specified value within an action request matches a specified rule then allow or block the action as configured. | `disable_mag_stripe` |
| Contains | If a specified value within an action request is contained in a list of enumerated control values then allow or block the action as configured. | `allowed_countries` |
| Comparative | If target value within an action request is greater than or less than a configured rule value, then block the action. | `atm_limit` |
| Measurement | As actions occur, a measurement is conditionally incremented based on action conditions and the real-time measurement vaue is compared to the configured rule value. If the measurement will exceed the rule value, then block the action. | `combined_purchase_1d` |
| Configuration | Control rules which contain configuration values for the management of actions or other controls rather than the decisioning of actions. | `overdraft_strategy` |

## How it works

To learn more about how E6 manages and enforces controls for you, read through the following documentation.

- [**Program controls**](/docs/controls/program-controls) - Controls set at the program level that are applied to groups of customers.
- [**Customer controls**](/docs/controls/customer-controls) - Customer controls are limitations placed on an individual customer accounts that can override program controls.
- [**Card controls**](/docs/controls/card-controls) - Card controls allow clients to restrict and limit how a specified card is used.
- [**Merchant controls**](/docs/controls/merchant-controls) - Merchant controls limit where cards purchases can be made through whitelisting or blacklisting.
- [**Organizational controls**](/docs/controls/organizational-controls) - Organizational controls enable velocity and reporting across an organizational structure.
- [**Control measurements**](/docs/controls/control-measurements) - Control measurements provide a view of progress against set controls thresholds.
- [**Control alerts**](/docs/controls/control-alerts) - Control alerts are notifications that a customer has met or exceeded a set control.
