# Person attributes

A person attribute is a piece of information that defines a person within a data model. Systems define persons differently across their data models. Inherently, each data model definition in a system remains relatively static. Static definitions cause issues when trying to customize the definition of a person or migrate persons between systems. To overcome the problem of static definitions, customizable person attributes are needed.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability for custom person attributes to be added to and maintained for a person. A person attribute is defined by the `name` and `value` of the attribute. Person attributes can be retrieved for a person or consumed as part of downstream processing.

## Prerequisites

Before a person attribute can be created, the person record must be created. For more information, see [Persons overview](/docs/persons/persons-overview).

## Actions

A person attribute can be added to a person by calling the [Create Person Attribute API](/tech-specs/persons/person-attributes/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.PersonAPI_createPersonAttribute_POST). Attributes should be uniquely named to ensure that person attributes follow a key-value pair model.

## What's next

After setting person attributes, you can manage them by calling the [Person Attributes APIs](/tech-specs/persons/person-attributes).
