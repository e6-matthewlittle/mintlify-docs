# Persons overview

A person is a natural person or legal entity with which you have a customer relationship. Legal entities can include anything from small business to a large multinational corporate. As needed a person can also be used to represent other concepts such as a project, a department, a team, and more. A person may act as an account holder or as a secondary account member for a customer account. Persons are associated with additional concepts such as geographical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and official government-issued IDs.
