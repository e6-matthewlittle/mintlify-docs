# Card attributes

A card attribute is a piece of information that defines a card within a data model. Systems define cards differently across their data models. Inherently, each data model definition in a system remains relatively static. Static definitions cause issues when trying to customize the definition of a card or migrate cards between systems. To overcome the problem of static definitions, customizable card attributes are needed.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides the ability for custom card attributes to be added to and maintained for a card. A card attribute is defined by the `name` and `value` of the attribute. Card attributes can be retrieved for a card or consumed as part of downstream processing.

## Prerequisites

Before a card attribute can be created, the card must be [issued](/docs/cards/issuance-overview).

## Actions

A card attribute can be added to a card by calling the [Create Card Attribute API](/tech-specs/cards/card-attributes/api?#operation/net.e6tech.h3.middletier.api.v1.partner.customer.CardAPI_createCardAttribute_POST). Attributes should be uniquely named to ensure that card attributes follow a key-value pair model.

## What's next

After setting card attributes, you can manage them by calling the [Card Attributes APIs](/tech-specs/cards/card-attributes).
