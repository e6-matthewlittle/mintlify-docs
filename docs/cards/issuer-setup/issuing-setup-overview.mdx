# Issuing setup

Once you've decided to launch a card product, a few standard activities are required before you card issue card for live clients. This process also varies depending on the scope of your card product and your level of involvement with the card network.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) works with you to get your card product setup and live using our standard issuing setup framework. This includes leveraging E6's existing integrations with card networks, sharing of best practices, guidance throughout the process, and support for testing with E6 as your issuer processor.

## How it works

To learn more about how you can get setup for card issuing with E6, read through the following documentation.

- [**Card networks**](/docs/cards/card-networks) - Choose which card network on which you will issue your cards
- [**IIN procurement**](/docs/cards/iin-procurement) - Procure an issuer identification number (IIN) from the card network or through an IIN sponsor
- [**Certification**](/docs/cards/certification) - Certify your IIN for production use with the card network
- [**PCI compliance**](/docs/cards/pci-compliance) - Establish your integration and operations based on being PCI-compliant or not
