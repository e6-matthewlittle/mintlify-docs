# Card networks

Card networks, or card schemes, enable transactions between cardholders and merchants & ATMs through card-based payment infrastructure.  The banks and institutions that facilitate payments on behalf of cardholders, called issuers, have to become "members" of card networks in order to connect their cardholders with merchants. Once onboarded, an issuer can generate cards for their customers to use in various card payment scenarios. Oftentimes, a specialized service provider or system called an issuer processor provides technical connectivity with the card networks for issuers. Card networks typically fall into two distinct categories:

* **Credit and signature debit - ** These card networks use dual-messaging where authorizations are performed per card presentment for a purchase and then merchants will request clearing / authorization capture in batches at a later time.
* **PIN debit - ** These card networks use single-messaging where authorization and clearing occur in the same process at the point of card presentment for a purchase or ATM withdrawal using PIN validation as a cardholder verification method.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) is an issuer processor with established connections with card networks around the globe. Through E6, you get access to global card network integrations including Mastercard, Visa, and UnionPay International (UPI). Additional regional or country-specific card network integrations are also available where E6 does business in order to meet regulatory requirements governing card payments.

## Actions

Launching a card program requires you to establish a relationship with one of the card networks - either directly or with a BIN/IIN sponsor. E6 provides technical access to the mentioned card networks, but clients are responsible for selecting a card network or sponsor with which to partner. The choice often is made based on the card product type, the acceptance rate of the card network, and the pricing offered to the issuer. Most clients use a single card network for all of their products, while larger clients may use multiple card networks across different products. Once onboarded to a card network, a member number will be provided. This number is called an Interbank Card Association (ICA) number for Mastercard and a center identification block (CIB) number for Visa.

## What's next

Once you have engaged with your selected card network, the card network team will help you determine what type of network card product best meets your needs so that you can procure a [BIN/IIN](/docs/cards/iin-procurement).
