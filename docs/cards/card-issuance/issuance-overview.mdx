# Card issuance

A card is a payment instrument that facilitates real-time payments through card networks. The card is connected to an underlying account which provides access to funds. Key aspects of a card that are used in card payments include the customer's primary account number (PAN), an optional personal identification number (PIN), cardholder details, the expiry, and a security code. Cards can be used to make purchases at merchants, withdraw cash at ATMs, card readers, retail apps, and other Points of Sale (POS). Issuance is the process of generating a new card.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) provides real-time issuance capabilities for all card types and use cases. At the point of card issuance, E6 generates all card details like Primary Account Numbers (PANs), security codes, and expiry as needed. E6 securely stores the card details including PCI-controlled data, like a customer's PAN. The PAN is encrypted according to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). E6 also provides non-PAN card identifiers so that cards can be identified and managed by your system without concerns for PCI compliance. Once a card has been issued and activated as needed, it can be used to make card payments.

PANs are typically segmented as follows: `BBBB BBBB SSNN NNNC`, where `B` = the specified card IIN, `S` = an optional IIN segment, `N` = unique number differentiating the PAN, and `C` = a check digit to ensure the PAN is valid given the combined digits. E6 offers two approaches to how PANs are generated. When generating cards, E6 uses sequential PAN generation by default where the next PAN is incremented by 1 digit from the last issued PAN. E6 also supports randomized PAN generation where there is no set pattern to the next PAN which is generated. While random PAN generation is theoretically more secure, it can cause issues when trying to later repurpose an IIN. If you prefer randomized PAN generation, contact your E6 representative.

## How it works

To learn more about how you can issue cards with E6, read through the following documentation.

- [**Card profiles**](/docs/cards/card-profiles) - Setting up a card issuance configuration profile for a program
- [**Physical cards**](/docs/cards/physical-cards) - Integration with a card manufacturer to create physical instances of a card
- [**Customer card issuance**](/docs/cards/customer-card-issuance) - Issuing or reissuing a single card for a specified customer account and cardholder
- [**Bulk card issuance**](/docs/cards/bulk-card-issuance) - Issuing one or more cards that are not initially associated with a customer or cardholder
- [**Card activation**](/docs/cards/card-activation) - Enabling use of a physical card once it has arrived and limiting use of the card before activation
- [**Card on file updaters**](/docs/cards/card-on-file-updaters) - Informing holders of cards on file such as merchants of updates to the card details upon reissuance
