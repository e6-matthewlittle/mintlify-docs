# Cards

Cards are payment instruments that contain information required for a payee to request real-time payment from a payer. The payer for card payments is the owner of a card, or cardholder. Most often, the payees are merchants who are selling goods or services to the cardholder, but can also include automated teller machines (ATMs). Card networks provide the connectivity between cardholder banks, called issuers, and merchant banks, called acquirers, to make card payments possible.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) gives you a complete card issuing solution with everything you need to launch and operate any card product. All card issuing capabilities are provided through E6's PCI-compliant, cloud-hosted platform that's deployed throughout the world.

E6 maintains technical integration with major card networks including Mastercard, Visa, and UnionPay International (UPI).
