Logging provides the ability to view and monitor system events. Each log entry includes the type of event, the time the event occurred, and the details of the event.

## What we do

Episode Six (E6) conducts logging across all activities within the TRITIUM platform including API requests as well as internal operations. This provides clients the ability to perform the following functions:

1. Monitor system activity for exceptions
2. Track the activity of different system users
3. Understand the history that lead to the current state of a customer

## Actions

Log entries for API operations can be retrieved using the [Logs API](/tech-specs/system/logs). Logs can be retrieved either by `customer` or by `user`. To improve the ability to debug using the logs API requests should include the headers of `X-Request-ID` and the `X-Correlation-ID`. For more information, see [Headers](/tech-specs/getting-started/headers).
