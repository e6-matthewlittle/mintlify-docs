Episode Six (E6) provides a standard set of environments to E6 Cloud clients throughout sales, implementation, and operation. Clients are able to use the different types of environments to support different types of activities related to interacting with the TRITIUM platform.

## Environment Types

E6 provides the following environments types to clients, prospects, and partners.

| Environment | Description |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Sandbox | A temporary environment to be used for exploration of the platform during the sales or partner engagement process using off-the-shelf configurations. |
| Testing (UAT) | A test environment that has all required test connections and mirrors client-specified product environment configurations to complete final end-to-end testing before go-live. |
| Production (PROD) | An environment for live processing of customer transactions with full connectivity into production instances of external party systems. |

## Environment Access

When access to an environment is provided, details of environments including URLs, whitelisted IP addresses, and user access credentials are sent in an initial setup guide. Environments may be provisioned incrementally depending on your implementation plans.
