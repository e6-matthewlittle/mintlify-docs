When a call is successful, you see the entire data structure returned. In the event of an unsuccessful call, you receive a response code and a text message indicating what issue occurred. An example for calling an API without a valid bearer token is shown below.

```json
{
    "responseCode": "205000",
    "message": "Token invalid."
}
```

The Episode Six (E6) Platform provides detailed response codes that go far beyond standard HTTP response codes. With the exception of Success and Failed, all major codes are six digits in length.

The first three digits of the six-digit code indicate the primary response. For codes with `xxx` in their value, an accompanying minor code is included in the response. For example, code `205044` indicates a major code of `205` ("Not Authorized") and a minor code of `044` ("AuthTokenId").

## Major codes

Major codes define the type of error code being returned. It answers the how or why of an error. Some major codes, such as 200xxx (Not Available), contain a minor code that describes what triggered the failure.

## Minor codes

Minor codes are how Tritium identifies which triggering object caused an error to occur. These numbers make up the last three digits of Not Available, Not Found, Not Authorized, Risk Rule error codes and Client-Specific error codes.
